Add content and stage it:
	$ echo "git reset" >> test
	$ git add test
	$ git status

Revert the changed content in workspace, since content is staged,
nothing in workspace is reverted:
	$ git checkout test
	$ git status

Clear the staged content:
	$ git reset test
	$ git status

Clear the chagned part:
	$ git checkout test
	$ git status

Add a new commit:
	$ echo "git reset" >> test
	$ git commit -a -m "third commit"

Remove the commit, but keeps its content:
	$ git reset HEAD~1
	$ git log

The changes of your third commit still keeps in workspace:
	$ git diff

Commit it again! For the next experiment:
	$ git commit -a -m "third commit"

Remove the commit, and clear your workspace too:
	$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
	$ git diff
